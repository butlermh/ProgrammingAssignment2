## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.
## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix 
## Creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(inv) i <<- inv
        getinv <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve c
## Computes the inverse of the special matrix returned by make cacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not been changed)
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getinv()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinv(i)
        i
}
